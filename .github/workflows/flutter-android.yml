# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHANGELOG:
# [2025-05-06] Initial version with debug build, manifest pre-check, artifact upload.
# [2025-05-06] Removed custom checkout path to avoid double-folder nesting.
# [2025-05-06] Set working-directory to midrange_ops_hub (later determined incorrect).
# [2025-05-07] 🛠 Final fix: Removed working-directory to build from repo root.

# [2025-05-07] 📦 Enabled verbose build logging for better error diagnosis.
# [2025-05-07] 🔧 Added Java setup and flutter clean steps for build reliability.
# [2025-05-07] 🧯 Attempted explicit checkout path + matching working-directory.
# [2025-05-07] 🔁 Reset to clean root context — no path, no working-dir.
# [2025-05-07] 🚀 Tried checkout path 'midrange_ops_hub' with matching working-directory.
# [2025-05-07] 🔍 Simplified to non-nested checkout with path '.' and working-directory '.'.
# [2025-05-07] 📜 Refined debugging, confirmed build.gradle.kts compatibility.
# [2025-05-07] ✅ Fixed nesting by setting working-directory to account for runner's default repo nesting.
