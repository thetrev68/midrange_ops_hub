# File: .github/workflows/flutter-android.yml
# Purpose: Uses raw Gradle call to bypass Flutter wrapper and diagnose CI failures
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHANGELOG:
# [2025-05-06] Initial build attempts.
# [2025-05-06] Removed custom checkout path to avoid double-folder nesting.
# [2025-05-06] Set working-directory to midrange_ops_hub (later determined incorrect).
# [2025-05-07] ✅ Reset: no checkout path, no working-directory override — runs from root.
# [2025-05-07] 🛠 Final fix: Removed working-directory to build from repo root.
# [2025-05-07] 🧠 Added Gradle cache steps to optimize CI performance.
# [2025-05-07] 📦 Enabled verbose build logging for better error diagnosis.
# [2025-05-07] 🔧 Added Java setup and flutter clean steps for build reliability.
# [2025-05-07] ✅ Flattened checkout structure using `path: .` to avoid runner nesting.
# [2025-05-07] 💥 Switched to raw Gradle build using ./gradlew for better control and logging.
